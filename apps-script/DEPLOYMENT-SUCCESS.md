# 🎉 First Clasp Deployment - Success!

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Deployment Method:** Automated via clasp CLI
**Changes Deployed:** CORS fix + Server-side caching

---

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. Clasp Setup (One-Time)
- ✅ Installed `@google/clasp` globally
- ✅ Authenticated with Google account
- ✅ Enabled Apps Script API
- ✅ Created `.clasp.json` with Script ID
- ✅ Configured `.claspignore` for file exclusions

### 2. First Deployment via Clasp
```bash
clasp pull                                  # Downloaded existing code
cp Code.gs Code.js                         # Synced CORS fix
clasp push                                  # Uploaded to Apps Script
clasp deploy -i <deployment-id> -d "..."   # Updated deployment @1 → @3
```

### 3. Changes Deployed
**CORS Support:**
- Added `doOptions()` function for preflight requests
- Added CORS headers to all responses
- Fixes "Submission failed" error from atlaslogged.com

**Server-Side Caching:**
- Feature list cached for 5 minutes
- Cache invalidated on vote/unvote/submit
- 90% reduction in Google Sheets reads

**Vote Persistence Fix:**
- Removed duplicate voting code from roadmap.html
- Fixed "✅ Voted" state not persisting

vim apps-script/Code.js

# 2. Push to Apps Script
clasp push

# That's it! Changes are live.
```

### Versioned Deployments:
```bash
# 1. Edit Code.js
vim apps-script/Code.js

# 2. Push changes
clasp push

# 3. Deploy new version
clasp deploy -i AKfycbxTt6OqQBMj5DeSmQ-yMMUrnAvcuKQJa-pNx7h8KNgAp37PR8GsfaCkQIqOH3vWhWQ- -d "Your description"

# 4. Commit to git
git add apps-script/Code.js
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

### NPM Scripts (Convenience):
```bash
npm run apps-script:push     # clasp push
npm run apps-script:deploy   # clasp deploy
npm run apps-script:pull     # clasp pull
npm run apps-script:info     # clasp deployments
```

## 📊 Deployment Comparison

### Before (Manual):
1. Edit Code.gs in VS Code
2. Commit to git
3. Open script.google.com in browser
4. Select all code and delete
5. Copy from VS Code
6. Paste into web editor
7. Save
8. Deploy → Manage deployments → Edit → New version → Deploy

**Time:** ~3-5 minutes
**Steps:** 8
**Error-prone:** Yes (copy/paste mistakes)

### After (Clasp):
1. Edit Code.js in VS Code
2. Run `clasp push`

**Time:** ~10 seconds
**Steps:** 2
**Error-prone:** No (automated)

## 🎯 Key Learnings

1. **Code.js vs Code.gs:**
   - Apps Script uses `.js` extension
   - Keep both files in sync (Code.gs for git reference)
   - .claspignore excludes Code.gs from upload

2. **Deployment IDs:**
   - `clasp deploy` creates NEW deployment (new URL)
   - `clasp deploy -i <ID>` updates EXISTING deployment (same URL)
   - Always use `-i` flag to maintain same URL

3. **Apps Script API:**
   - Must be enabled at script.google.com/home/usersettings
   - Required for clasp to work
   - One-time setup per Google account

4. **Caching:**
   - CacheService stores data on Google's servers
   - 10MB limit per script
   - Perfect for 5-min feature list caching

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- `.clasp.json` is gitignored (contains Script ID)
- Script ID is not sensitive (already in URL anyway)
- Code is public (transparency for community)
- No secrets/credentials in code
