# Performance Analysis: Baseline vs Optimized

## Test Environment
- Date: 2025-10-30
- API: Google Apps Script (Roadmap API)
- Test runs: 5 iterations per scenario

## Baseline Results (Unoptimized - Full Sheet Scans)

| Scenario | Min | Avg | Max |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|
| Warm Container | 1382ms | 1835ms | 3051ms |
| Vote (First Time) | 2134ms | **2688ms** | 3025ms |
| Vote (Cached Row) | 2202ms | **2916ms** | 4307ms |
| Get Features (Cache Hit) | 2455ms | 2999ms | 4394ms |
| Get Features (Cache Miss) | 1148ms | 1518ms | 1835ms |

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Cached Row Lookup (`getFeatureRow`)
**Problem**: Vote/unvote operations were reading entire sheet on every request  
**Solution**: Cache row numbers for 1 hour to avoid repeated full sheet scans  
**Expected Impact**: 40-60% reduction in vote operation time on cached rows

### 2. Smart Cache Update (`updateCachedFeatureList`)  
**Problem**: Every vote invalidated the entire feature list cache  
**Solution**: Update vote count in cached feature list instead of invalidating  
**Expected Impact**: Eliminates need to regenerate feature list on every vote

### 3. Targeted Range Reads
**Problem**: Reading entire data range for single cell updates  
**Solution**: Read only specific cells needed (e.g., just column 4 for votes)  
**Expected Impact**: Reduced data transfer and processing time

## Expected Performance After Deployment

| Scenario | Baseline Avg | Expected Optimized | Improvement |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Vote (First Time) | 2688ms | ~1600ms | **40% faster** |
| Vote (Cached Row) | 2916ms | ~800-1200ms | **60-70% faster** |
| Get Features (Cache Hit) | 2999ms | ~2000ms | **33% faster** |

## Key Metrics

**Before Optimization:**
- All vote operations: **2.6-2.9 seconds**
- No difference between first vote and cached row vote

**After Optimization (Expected):**
- First time vote: **~1.6 seconds** (row lookup needed)
- Cached row vote: **~0.8-1.2 seconds** (row cached)
- **Cached row is 50% faster than first vote**

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes
- Added `getFeatureRow()` function with 1-hour row number caching
- Added `updateCachedFeatureList()` for in-place cache updates
- Modified `handleVote()` to use cached lookups
- Modified `handleUnvote()` to use cached lookups
- Retained all backup logging functionality

### Deployment Required
The optimizations are implemented in:
- `apps-script/Code.gs`
- `apps-script/Code.js`

To deploy and test real performance:
```bash
npm run apps-script:push
npm run benchmark
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** the optimized code to Google Apps Script
2. **Run benchmark** again to measure actual improvements
3. **Compare** results using `npm run benchmark:compare`
4. **Monitor** Apps Script logs for cache hit rates

## Cache Strategy

| Cache Key | TTL | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| `feature_list` | 5 min | Full feature list response |
| `feature_row_{id}` | 1 hour | Row number for feature ID |
| `vote_{hash}_{id}` | 24 hours | User vote tracking |

The combination of these caches creates a multi-tier optimization strategy that minimizes database reads while maintaining data consistency.
